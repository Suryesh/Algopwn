# Algopwn
Algopwn is an interactive Python tool for security researchers and bug-bounty hunters to audit Algolia API keys. It detects ACLs, distinguishes read-only vs sensitive permissions, enumerates indexes, and — with explicit confirmation — performs a controlled PoC and prints a verification URL. Built for responsible use only.
